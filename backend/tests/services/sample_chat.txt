To download and run an application from your Samsung T7 SSD on your MacBook, follow these steps:

1. Download the Application to Your SSD
Ensure your SSD is properly connected to your MacBook.
In Chrome, set your download location to your SSD:
Open Chrome Settings â†’ Downloads (chrome://settings/downloads).
Click Change under Location and select your Samsung T7 SSD.
Download the application.
2. Install or Run the Application from the SSD
Depending on the type of application file, follow these steps:

If itâ€™s a .dmg (Disk Image) file:
Double-click the .dmg file in the SSD folder (/Volumes/T7).
A window will open with the app and an Applications folder shortcut.
Drag and drop the app into the Applications folder.
Eject the .dmg by right-clicking and selecting Eject.
If itâ€™s a .zip file:
Double-click the .zip file to extract it.
A folder or .app file should appear.
Move the extracted .app file to /Applications (or keep it on your SSD if preferred).
If itâ€™s a .pkg (Installer Package) file:
Double-click the .pkg file.
Follow the installation prompts.
It may install directly to Applications, or you may need to select your SSD as the install destination.
3. Running the Application
If you moved it to Applications, open Launchpad (F4 or via Spotlight) and click the app.
If you kept it on the SSD, navigate to /Volumes/T7/YourApp.app, and double-click to open.

If macOS blocks it with a message like "App canâ€™t be opened because it is from an unidentified developer", do this:

Go to System Settings â†’ Privacy & Security.
Scroll down and find the message about the app being blocked.
Click Open Anyway.
4. Keeping the App on Your SSD (Optional)
If you donâ€™t want to move the app to Applications, you can run it directly from your Samsung T7:

Navigate to /Volumes/T7/YourApp.app.

If it doesnâ€™t open, go to System Settings â†’ Privacy & Security, find the app, and click Open Anyway.
